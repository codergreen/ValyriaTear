*** \brief Manages and maintains all of the living game mode objects.
***
*** The ModeEngine class keeps a stack of GameMode objects, where the object
*** on the top of the stack is the active GameMode (there can only be one active
*** game mode at any time). The Update() and Draw() functions for this class are
*** wrapper calls to the GameMode functions of the same name, and act on the
*** active game mode.
***
*** When a condition is encountered in which a game mode wishes to destroy itself
*** and/or push a new mode onto the stack, this does not occur until the next
*** call to the ModeEngine#Update() function. The GameModeManager#push_stack
*** retains all the game modes we wish to push onto the stack on the next call to
*** ModeEngine#Update(), and the GameModeManager#pop_count member retains
*** how many modes to delete and pop off the ModeEngine#game_stack. Pop
*** operations are \b always performed before push operations.
***
*** \note 1) This class is a singleton.
***
*** \note 2) You might be wondering why the game stack uses a vector container
*** rather than a stack container. There are two reasons: the first being that
*** we can't do a debug printout of the game_stack without removing elements *if*
*** a stack is used. The second reason is "just in case" we need to access a stack
*** element that is not on the top of the stack.
