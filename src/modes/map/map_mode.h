*** \brief   Header file for map mode interface.
***
*** This file contains the interface for map mode, active when the player is
*** exploring town or dungeon maps. The map environments are
*** quite extensive, thus this code is responsible for processing many things.
*** This includes handling all tile images, objects, sprites, map events,
*** dialogue, and more.
***
*** Each individual map is represented by it's own object of the MapMode class.
*** It is our intention in the future to retain more than one map in memory at
*** once to reduce or eliminate loading times when the player transitions
*** between maps.

*** \brief Handles the game execution while the player is exploring maps.
***
*** This class contains all of the structures that together compose each map.
*** Each map has a Lua script file in which the map data is permanently retained
*** and various script subroutines exist that modify the map's behavior. Keep in
*** mind that this class alone does not represent all of the data nor all of the
*** code that is used in a particular map, as the map's Lua file likely retains
*** additional information about the map that is not represented in this class.
***
*** Maps are composed by a series of tiles and objects. Tiles are 32x32 pixel
*** squares that are adjacent to one another on a map, and together make up the
*** map's background environment. Objects are variable sized entities that are
*** usually living, animated creatures (sprites), but may be something static
*** such as a large tree. Tiles and objects are drawn in multiple interwieving
*** layers to emulate a 3D environment for the game. Additionally each map has
*** a collision grid composed of 16x16 pixel elements that determine which
*** quadrants of each tile may be occupied by sprites or other objects.
***
*** Another important concept to MapMode is that of contexts. Each map has at
*** least one context and can have up to a maximum of 32 contexts. Every context
*** has its own collision grid and its own set of tiles. Map objects and sprites
*** exist in one of these context and may change their context at any time.
*** Objects and sprites can not interact with one another when they are not
*** within the same context, and typically only objects that are in the same
*** context as the map camera are visible on the screen. You can think of each
*** context as essentially its own map, and the set of contexts as a set of maps
*** that work with one another to create a cohesive environment.
***
*** Because this game mode is so complex, the MapMode class shares its
*** responsibilities with several small singleton classes that manage a
*** particular area of map code, such as tiles or objects. These sub-manager
*** classes should be viewed as extensions of the MapMode class.
